Trying to make a mini game with Unity.
Yes, IT'S A TEST!!!!!

This will be a game to jump to the top of the growing tree.

Maybe there will be a short story for it.

One day, Our hero saw a little crying beside the road.
"What's the matter with you ?"
"My balloon, My balloon fly away!"
"Oh, it's pretty high hum? Let's see how can I get it....."
(Then a magical tree begin to grow up)
"Maybe I can get the ballon with climbing the tree?"

Then, the game begin!!
